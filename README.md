It also makes use of Firebase Database, Storage and Cloud Functions. Service worker is implemented both with static/dynamic caching directly and Google’s Workbox library. 
 You can add the app to your phone home screen directly (no app store anymore), run the app offline, submit you (applicant’s) data even if you are offline, subscribe and get notifications. You can run the app both on your mobile and dektop.
